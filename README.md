These modules are usually essential constructs, reoccurring constructs that may be reused between projects. Because there are no one package manager for Godot, this repository is meant as just a temporary holding place.

# Setup

1. Find the modules you want in `modules/package-name`
2. Download the files and paste it in your projects.
3. Read the docs and use it.
